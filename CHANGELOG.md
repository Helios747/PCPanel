# PCPanel Controller Software

<!-- Releasenotes without version are included in releases -->

**Warning:** This version uses a new format for the savefile.
A backup will be made when converting. If you want to downgrade to a previous version, you can restore the backup.

**New:**

- #38 - Add double click action to buttons
- It is now possible to add more than one action to a button or slider
    - There is also an option to run them all at once when a button is pressed, or sequentially
    - Dials currently only support all at once
- #41 - Dial/Slider values are applied when VoiceMeeter starts
- Dial/Slider values are applied when OBS starts
- #39 - Allow showing the actual volume number (0-100, linear) and additional color settings in overlay
- Dials/sliders can be inverted (combined with multiple commands, this will make it possible to cross-fade, but volume levels aren't useful for that yet)
- The overlay allows showing the actual value (this differs from the slider state when using logarithmic scaling)
- #59 - Additional overlay options (colors, rounding, size and position)
- #45 - Voicemeeter string values are now supported for advanced button actions

**Fixes:**

- Pressing escape when a dialog is open will close the dialog
- Version check is done using the GitHub version api and will notify when a new snapshot is available
- [Linux] #44 - pactl commands are run in English so that their output can be parsed correctly
- [Windows] #57 - The end focussed task command works again
- #58 - VoiceMeeter lowest value is now 60 instead of -inf making it behave better

**Fixes within the snapshot:**
(not relevant when not upgrading from a previous snapshot)

- Commands can be removed again
- Commands that are not supported or not enabled are not shown

## [1.6]

**New:**

- [Windows] There is now also an advanced toggle that allows changing the media/communication devices through toggles
- There is now a slider for device brightness. This will apply to all device options. It's also possible to adjust the device brightness via a knob/slider.
- #22 - Mute override colors also work when controlling OBS input volume
- Button action to toggle focus mute ([from request](https://www.reddit.com/r/PCPanel/comments/zyh3sr/toggle_muteunmute_focused_application/))
- Some button actions (the default device toggles) now also show overlay hints ([from request](https://www.reddit.com/r/PCPanel/comments/zhun8a/feature_suggestion_add_a_little_indicatoroverlay/))
- #26 - Allow switching default device for a process (specific or follow focus)
- #27 - Initial support for OSC (Open Sound Control) protocol
- #29 - VoiceMeeter mute state support

**Fixes:**

- If it wasn't possible to get the executable for a path, the AppFinder dialog would not show any results
- When the connection to OBS fails with an error, the reconnect attempts will still be done
- [Windows] Some additional checks are being done in the c++ parts so that the application should crash less (or hopefully not at all anymore)
- [Linux] The application doesn't use `pacmd` anymore, only `pactl` to also be compatible with PipeWire
- [Linux] The application can start when no tray extensions are available
- [Linux] It's possible to disable the tray icon by adding `-Ddisable.tray` as a command line parameter
- [Linux] All audio streams for a process will be changed when a process is controlled
- [Linux] Processes without a PID or Executable can be controlled
- Starting the application again (when skipfilecheck is not specified) will show the main window
- #24 - Controlling Discord via focus volume would also change the microphone volume
- The mute color should not overwrite the color configuration anymore
- The application should start with the profile that was last used (unless a Main profile is specified)

## [1.5]

**New:**

- Added a feature that might fix twitching sliders on faulty hardware (#6)
- [Linux] Allow controlling input volume (#10)
- Allow configuring what the mute override color follows
- OBS Websocket 5 (OBS 28) support. Don't use this version of the software if you are still using OBS 27 or lower without the Websocket 5 plugin.
- [Windows] An option was added to show an overlay when volume is changed and to show icons of the controlled applications in the main ui.
  From [request](https://www.reddit.com/r/PCPanel/comments/xf14ol)

**Fixes:**

- An error would be logged when the mute override service triggered while a device did not use custom colors
- The application names are now case-insensitive for volume changing or muting
- Profile switching using a shortcut is disabled on Linux, it crashed the VM on certain distros
- OBS volume range is now from -97 (-inf db) to 0 instead of -100 to 26
- Removed Roboto font, hoping to fix [this issue](https://www.reddit.com/r/PCPanel/comments/xh0dy4/)

## [1.4]

**New:**

- Added button action to set the default device based on the (partial) name. This might be helpful if Windows reconnects devices with different id's.
- The 'Toggle device' action only works for all output or all input devices, not a combination of both
- Allow controlling only Spotify with the media keys instead of any application that is playing sound (fix for #3)

**Fixes:**

- When connecting a mini or rgb for the first time, an NPE would occur which would prevent the software from finding the device.
- The right-click link to open lighting options was broken, should actually work now.
- Fix the process picker, it gave a ClassCastException
- Allow setting system sounds when the process does not have pid 0
- It's possible to drag audio devices into the Selected Devices list in the Toggle Device button option again (fix for #2)
- Updated JNativeHook so that dead keys keep working (fix for #4)
- Applications that have multiple audio sessions should now be controlled correctly

## [1.3]

**New:**

- When there is no saved profile but there is one from the original software, ask to migrate on startup
- Right clicking a knob or slider opens the lighting dialog
    - Middle click already triggered the click action (I did not know that)
- It's now possible to configure a 'Mute override' color which will show a different color when the controlled device is muted
- Volume change actions now have an option to unmute the device/process
- The App Finder dialogs have a filter field
- An option was added to assign a shortcut to profiles to switch between them
- **Initial Linux compatibility**
    - A lot of options probably won't work correctly yet
    - The UI seems a bit buggy on Ubuntu 22.04 (flashing/blacking out)
    - But volume controlling seems to work mostly for processes, devices and focus volume

**Fixes:**

- Its possible to configure an alternative profile folder for development purposes
- Controlling OBS volume is now done with [db's instead of mul](https://github.com/obsproject/obs-websocket/blob/4.x-compat/docs/generated/protocol.md#setvolume), this gives the slider a better range

## [1.2]

**New:**

- Added options to automatically switch to a profile when other windows get focus
- You can set a main profile which will be loaded when you start the application
- Added version checker. If a new version is released the UI will show that with a link to the download page.
- More than 2 processes can be selected for volume control
- More than 1 process can be selected for muting
- If a controlled application starts, the volume will be set immediately

**Fixes:**

- Profile save structure is changed to allow adding new features more easily
- Getting the list of running processes doesn't crash the application anymore
- The 'Open logfile' button now opens the correct folder
